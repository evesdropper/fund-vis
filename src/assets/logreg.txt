Similar to linear regression, but since the points are trending towards being nonlinear, we can use a logarithmic transformation to make the data more linear. This is done by taking the logarithm of the data, specifically the $x$ variable.

We now end up with something like $y = m\log(x) + b$ and a graph that resembles a logarithmic curve. Interpreting the equation is similar to linear regression, but the predicted value takes the log of $x$ instead of $x$ in the linear model.
